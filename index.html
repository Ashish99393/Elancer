          Big data is very quickly becoming a vital tool for businesses and
          companies of all sizes. The availability and interpretation of big
          data has altered the business models of old industries and enabled the
          creation of new ones.Data-driven businesses are worth $1.2 trillion
          collectively in 2020, an increase from $333 billion in the year
          2015.Data scientists are responsible for breaking down big data into
          usable information and creating software and algorithms that help
          companies and organizations determine optimal operations. As big data
          continues to have a major impact on the world, data science does as
          well due to the close relationship between the two.

          Data mining is a particular data analysis technique that focuses on
          statistical modeling and knowledge discovery for predictive rather
          than purely descriptive purposes, while business intelligence covers
          data analysis that relies heavily on aggregation, focusing mainly on
          business information.In statistical applications, data analysis can be
          divided into descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis, and
          confirmatory data analysis. EDA focuses on discovering new features in
          the data while CDA focuses on confirming or falsifying existing
          hypotheses. Predictive analytics focuses on application of statistical
          models for predictive forecasting or classification, while text
          analytics applies statistical, linguistic, and structural techniques
          to extract and classify information from textual sources, a species of
          unstructured data. All of the above are varieties of data analysis.

          Current usage of the term big data tends to refer to the use of
          predictive analytics, user behavior analytics, or certain other
          advanced data analytics methods that extract value from data, and
          seldom to a particular size of data set. "There is little doubt that
          the quantities of data now available are indeed large, but that's not
          the most relevant characteristic of this new data ecosystem." Analysis
          of data sets can find new correlations to "spot business trends,
          prevent diseases, combat crime and so on."Scientists, business
          executives, medical practitioners, advertising and governments alike
          regularly meet difficulties with large data-sets in areas including
          Internet searches, fintech, urban informatics, and business
          informatics. Scientists encounter limitations in e-Science work,
          including meteorology, genomics,connectomics, complex physics
          simulations, biology and environmental research.
